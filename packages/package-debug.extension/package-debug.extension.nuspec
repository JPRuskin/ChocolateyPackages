This extension provides logic that can be used to debug Chocolatey packages during development.

### Triggering Debug
To initiate debugging during package runtime, either pass a debug parameter (as shown below) or set `$env:ChocoPackageDebug` to any non-false value.

Example:
```powershell
choco install package-id --params="'/Debug'"
```

You can trigger the breakpoint at various different parts of the package by providing a specific value via `/Debug` or `$env:ChocoPackageDebug`.

*Note: Values passed to the package parameter will override the environment variable.*

You can set the breakpoint to a variety of predefined locations:

- `Prehook`: Waits before any prehook scripts are evaluated
- `Posthook`: Waits before any posthook scripts are evaluated
- `Package`: Waits before any package scripts (e.g. chocolateyInstall.ps1) are evaluated

You can provide these values by setting the environment variable, or passing them as the value of the `/Debug` parameter:

```powershell
$env:ChocoPackageDebug = "Prehook"
choco install package-id

# or

$env:ChocoPackageDebug = $null
choco install package-id --params"/Debug=Posthook"
```

You can also set a specific line number in the `chocolateyScriptRunner.ps1` file, by setting a line number.

### Entering the Debug Session

When your package waits for your debugger, you should see output similar to the following:

```plaintext
Now waiting for debug connection. To enter debugging write:
Enter-PSHostProcess -Id '38832'
Debug-Runspace -Id '1'
```

You can then connect to that debugger by running those lines in a terminal.

You can also connect to this debug runtime in the PowerShell ISE or Visual Studio Code by using the PowerShell extension.

This will provide a more in-depth debugging experience, including showing the script.

#### Windows PowerShell ISE

As in the terminal above, to debug using Windows PowerShell ISE, use `Enter-PSHostProcess` and `Debug-Runspace` to enter the debugger.

#### VSCode

For VSCode, you will require the PowerShell VSCode extension.

If you then create a `launch.json` file within a `.vscode` folder in your workspace (or open the Command Palette and select `Debug: Add Configuration`) and create something similar to the following:

```json
{
    "version": "0.2.0",
    "configurations": [
        {
            "name": "PowerShell Attach Interactive Session Runspace",
            "type": "PowerShell",
            "request": "attach",
            "runspaceId": 1
        }
    ]
}
```

You can then enter debug with `F5` (by default), and select the `choco` PID.

*Note: Your debug tool must match the elevation of the Chocolatey process.*
