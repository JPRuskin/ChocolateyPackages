    <summary>Lightning-fast mouse control with the keyboard.</summary>
    <description><![CDATA[# Mouseless

## 1, 2, click

Click anywhere on-screen in less than 2 seconds, simply by typing a few coordinates.

Other solutions ("mouse keys") take up to 10 seconds per click.

An on-screen overlay guides you, so no memorization is needed.

## Why Mouseless?

### Complete Control

Click, move, drag, drop, and scroll. Double and triple click. Left, right, middle, back, and forward buttons. Mouseless does it all.

### Supercharged Productivity

Mouseless saves you precious time when a keyboard shortcut isn't practical, available, or known. No more reaching for those one-off clicks!

### Elevated Accessibility

People who can't use mice deserve an efficient, full-featured alternative -- Mouseless is exactly that.

### Health-saving Ergonomics

Laptop trackpads can be dangerous for prolonged use -- Mouseless prevents strain and injury by reducing reliance on trackpads.

## Licensing

This product requires a purchased license for use, but you can activate a two week trial after installation.
