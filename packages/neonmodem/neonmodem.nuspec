        <description><![CDATA[
[*Neon Modem Overdrive*][neonmodem] is a [BBS][wiki-bbs]-style command line client that supports [Discourse][discourse], [Lemmy][lemmy], [Lobsters][lobsters] and [Hacker News][hackernews] as backends, and seamlessly integrates all of them into a streamlined TUI. And yes, you heard that right, I really did call it *Neon Modem Overdrive*.

*Neon Modem* is built in Go, using [Charm's Bubble Tea][bubbletea] TUI framework, but implements an own *window manager* (or *compositor* if you want) that allows it to use a third dimension, on top of the two dimensional rendering that Bubble Tea offers today. With that it is possible to display dialogs on top of one another, in order to offer a smoother UI experience.
